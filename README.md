### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[![GitHub Streak](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com?user=Vincent-Baret-974&theme=react)](https://git.io/streak-stats)

My name is Vincent and I'm a **mobile application developer** ðŸ“± from Reunion Island ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡ª 

I'm passionate about creating innovative and user-friendly apps that make people's lives easier ðŸŒ± 

I have experience working with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including cross-platform technologies like Flutter and React Native, as well as native technologies like Swift and Kotlin. 

Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter in my free time, but my day-to-day job involves coding with Swift and Kotlin.

![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-%237F52FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=kotlin&logoColor=white)

I've also experienced web development with React.js and Vue.js. Here are some technologies that I've already used:

![MUI](https://img.shields.io/badge/MUI-%230081CB.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mui&logoColor=white)

During internships, I've also gained practical experience with some backend technologies such as:
